## Abstract



## Bio
Prajna Hebbar is a third year PhD student in the Department of Biomolecular Engineering at the University of California Santa Cruz under the supervision of Dr Benedict Paten. She is extremely interested in developing methods for comparative and pan- genomics, with a focus on gene annotation. Her most recent efforts have been to assemble and annotate the complete T2T genome of the common marmoset. She also is currently working on annotating the human pangenome. She also previously annotated the complete T2T genomes of the primates from the T2T Primates project.
