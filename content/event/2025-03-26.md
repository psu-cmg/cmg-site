## Abstract
In this talk, I will discuss some statistical and computational approaches we are using to integrate multiple layers of big data (including multi-omics, neuroimaging and electronic health records) from large-scaled biobanks to understand genetic overlaps between the brain and complex human diseases, predict risk of disease 5 to 10 years in advance as well as time-of-onset of disease, and present some interactive data visualization tools.


## Bio
Dr. Yogasudha (Sudha) Veturi, Ph.D., is an Assistant Professor of Biobehavioral Health and Statistics at Penn State University. She holds a master’s degree in statistics from North Carolina State University, a master’s (thesis) degree in plant quantitative genetics from the University of Delaware and a Ph.D. at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where she developed statistical methods to understand genetic architectures of complex human traits in diverse populations. She completed her postdoctoral research in the Department of Genetics at the University of Pennsylvania, where she integrated her expertise in statistical model development and quantitative genetics with electronic health records data from large-scale biobanks to address meaningful healthcare related problems.
