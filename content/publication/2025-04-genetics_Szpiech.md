abstract = "Population genetic theory, and the empirical methods built upon it, often assumes that individuals pair randomly for reproduction. However, natural populations frequently violate this assumption, which may potentially confound genome-wide association studies, selection scans, and demographic inference. Within several recently admixed human populations, empirical genetic studies have reported a correlation in global ancestry proportion between spouses, referred to as ancestry-assortative mating. Here, we use forward genomic simulations to link correlations in global ancestry proportion between mates to the underlying mechanistic mate choice process. We consider the impacts of 2 types of mate choice model, using either ancestry-based preferences or social groups as the basis for mate pairing. We find that multiple mate choice models can produce the same correlations in global ancestry proportion between spouses; however, we also highlight alternative analytic approaches and circumstances in which these models may be distinguished. With this work, we seek to highlight potential pitfalls when interpreting correlations in empirical data as evidence for a particular model of human mating practices and to offer suggestions toward development of new best practices for analysis of human ancestry-assortative mating."
