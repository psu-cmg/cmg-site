abstract = "### Summary\nWith increased generation of high-resolution sequence-based ‘Omics’ data, detecting statistically significant effects at different genomic locations and scales has become key to addressing several scientific questions. IWTomics is an R/Bioconductor package (integrated in Galaxy) that, exploiting sophisticated Functional Data Analysis techniques (i.e. statistical techniques that deal with the analysis of curves), allows users to pre-process, visualize and test these data at multiple locations and scales. The package provides a friendly, flexible and complete workflow that can be employed in many genomic and epigenomic applications.\n### Availability and implementation\nIWTomics is freely available at the Bioconductor website (http://bioconductor.org/packages/IWTomics) and on the main Galaxy instance (https://usegalaxy.org/).\n### Supplementary information\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
