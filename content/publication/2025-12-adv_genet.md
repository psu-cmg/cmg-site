abstract = "AI-enabled facial genetics research has transformative potential for biomedical and forensic applications, but raises serious ethical, legal, and social challenges. Candor and clarity promote the advancement of science and facilitate the development of evidence-informed and ethically sound policy guardrails for scientific applications. Expanding upon our recent Comment on Difface, here we examine some of the ethical dimensions of AI-enabled facial genetics research, illuminate a lack of practical guidance for AI-enabled facial genetics research, and contextualize potential impacts within the current legal and policy landscape. Given the lack of standards and benchmarks for DNA-based face generation, we use Difface as a case study to stress the need for transparent performance metrics and clear disclosure of data flows across AI training, validation, and testing pipelines—enabling non-experts to assess accuracy meaningfully. Finally, we offer practical guidance for scientists to promote trustworthiness and stimulate further discussion within professional societies—guidance urgently needed in sociopolitically-turbulent and deregulatory environments. Risks of misinformation, disinformation, and discriminatory application of facial genetics research are too serious to ignore."
