abstract = "Mitochondria, cellular powerhouses, harbor DNA [mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)] inherited from the mothers. mtDNA mutations can cause diseases, yet whether they increase with age in human oocytes remains understudied. Here, using highly accurate duplex sequencing, we detected de novo mutations in single oocytes, blood, and saliva in women 20 to 42 years of age. We found that, with age, mutations increased in blood and saliva but not in oocytes. In oocytes, mutations with high allele frequencies were less prevalent in coding than noncoding regions, whereas mutations with low allele frequencies were more uniformly distributed along the mtDNA, suggesting frequency-dependent purifying selection. Thus, mtDNA in human oocytes is protected against accumulation of mutations with aging and having functional consequences. These findings are particularly timely as humans tend to reproduce later in life."
