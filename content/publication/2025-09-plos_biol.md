abstract = "Human genetic determinants of the gut mycobiome remain uninvestigated despite decades of research highlighting tripartite relationships between gut bacteria, genetic background, and disease. Here, we present the first genome-wide association study on the number and types of human genetic loci influencing gut fungi relative abundance. We detect 148 fungi-associated variants (FAVs) across 7 chromosomes that statistically associate with 9 fungal taxa. Of these FAVs, several occur in the protein-coding genes PTPRC, ANAPC10, NAV2, and CDH13. Additional FAVs link to tissue-specific gene expression as fungi-associated expression quantitative trait loci. Notably, the relative abundance of gut yeast Kazachstania associates with genetic variation in CDH13 encoding T-cadherin, a protein linked to cardiovascular disease. Kazachstania forms a causal relationship with cardiovascular disease risk in a mendelian two-sample randomization analysis. These findings establish previously unrecognized connections between human genetics, gut fungi, and chronic disease, broadening the paradigm of human-microbe interactions in the gut to the mycobiome."
