abstract = "Human genetic admixture, involving the contact between two or more previously isolated populations, can be a complex process influenced by social dynamics. In this study, we aim to reconstruct complex admixture histories in São Tomé, an island in the Gulf of Guinea where the Portuguese established one of the first plantation-based slave societies. Since the 15th century, migration waves from Africa and Europe, slavery, marooning, and indentured labour led to profound demographic shifts and social stratification on the island. Examining 2.5 million SNPs newly genotyped in 96 São Toméans, we observed patterns of genetic differentiation that were more complex than those of other populations descended from enslaved Africans on either side of the Atlantic. Using local ancestry inference and Identical-by-Descent methods, we identified five genetic clusters in São Tomé and reconstructed shared ancestries between each cluster and 70 African and European population samples, including an extensive sample from the Cabo Verde archipelago. Our findings align with historical records, retracing the major slave trade routes and labour-driven migrations after the abolition of slavery. We also identified gene flow between recently admixed groups that were previously isolated on the island. We call this process, creating multiple layers of genetic ancestry in admixed genomes, nested admixture. We suggest that changing social structures in São Tomé transformed the genetic structure of its population and influenced the admixture process. This study demonstrates how successive admixture and isolation events during and after the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade shaped extant genetic diversity patterns at local scale in Africa."
