abstract = "Purpose: The concepts of X-linked (XL) dominant and recessive inheritance originated long before dosage compensation for X chromosome genes was understood, but now have no scientific basis. However, misunderstanding of the underlying biology persists, prompting our reassessment of XL inheritance. Methods: We reviewed data on penetrance, expressivity, and X chromosome inactivation (XCI) for 55 XL genes and 57 XL disorders, and examined variations in inheritance based on disease severity, XCI status, cell selection, and other factors. Results: Our analysis demonstrated widely varying penetrance among heterozygous females that was related to severity of the phenotype particularly in males, the degree of cell selection shown by XCI patterns, cell autonomous or non-cell autonomous function of the gene product, and rare cellular interference. Conclusion: The conventional classification of XL inheritance into dominant and recessive subtypes is biologically flawed and should be retired. A more nuanced framework for understanding XL disorders is needed that accounts for the underlying biological complexity, and we propose 4 new groups of XL disorders with different patterns that should improve genetic diagnosis and counseling in families with XL disorders."
