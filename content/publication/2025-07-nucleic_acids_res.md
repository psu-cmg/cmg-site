abstract = "Variant annotation is a crucial objective in mammalian functional genomics. Deep mutational scanning (DMS) using saturation libraries of complementary DNAs (cDNAs) is a well-established method for annotating human gene variants, but CRISPR base editing (BE) is emerging as an alternative. However, questions remain about how well high-throughput BE measurements can annotate variant function and the extent of downstream experimental validation required. This study is the first direct comparison of cDNA DMS and BE in the same lab and cell line. We focus on how well short guide RNA (sgRNA) depletion or enrichment is explained by the predicted edits within the editing \"window\" defined by the sgRNA. The most likely predicted edits enhance the agreement between a \"gold standard\" DMS dataset and a BE screen. A simple filter for sgRNAs making single edits in their window could sufficiently annotate a large proportion of variants directly from sgRNA sequencing of large pools. When multi-edit guides are unavoidable, directly measuring edits in medium-sized validation pools can recover high-quality variant annotation data. Our data show a surprisingly high degree of correlation between base editor data and gold standard DMS. We suggest that the main variable measured in base editor screens is the desired base edits."
