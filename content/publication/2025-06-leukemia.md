abstract = "The IKZF1 gene encodes IKAROS - a DNA binding protein that acts as a tumor suppressor in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). IKAROS can act as a transcriptional repressor via recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and chromatin remodeling, however the mechanisms through which IKAROS exerts its tumor suppressor function via heterochromatin in T-ALL are largely unknown. We studied human and mouse T-ALL using a loss-of-function and IKZF1 re-expression approach, along with primary human T-ALL, and normal human and mouse thymocytes to establish the role of IKAROS and HDAC1 in global regulation of facultative heterochromatin and transcriptional repression in T-ALL. Results identified novel IKAROS and HDAC1 functions in T-ALL: Both IKAROS and HDAC1 are essential for EZH2 histone methyltransferase activity and formation of facultative heterochromatin; recruitment of HDAC1 by IKAROS is critical for establishment of H3K27me3 histone modification and repression of active enhancers; and IKAROS-HDAC1 complexes promote formation and expansion of H3K27me3 Large Organized Chromatin lysine (K) domains (LOCKs) and Broad Genic Repression Domains (BGRDs) in T-ALL. Our results establish the central role of IKAROS and HDAC1 in activation of EZH2, global regulation of the facultative heterochromatin landscape, and silencing of active enhancers that regulate oncogene expression."
