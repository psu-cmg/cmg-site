abstract = "Motif discovery is gaining increasing attention in the domain of functional data analysis. Functional motifs are typical "shapes" or "patterns" that recur multiple times in different portions of a single curve and/or in misaligned portions of multiple curves. In this paper, we define functional motifs using an additive model and we propose funBIalign for their discovery and evaluation. Inspired by clustering and biclustering techniques, funBIalign is a multi-step procedure which uses agglomerative hierarchical clustering with complete linkage and a functional distance based on mean squared residue scores to discover functional motifs, both in a single curve (e.g., time series) and in a set of curves. We assess its performance and compare it to other recent methods through extensive simulations. Moreover, we use funBIalign for discovering motifs in two real-data case studies; one on food price inflation and one on temperature changes."
