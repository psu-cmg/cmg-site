abstract = "Despite a thorough understanding of the structure of human papillomavirus (HPV) and its genotypic variations (high-risk and low-risk variants), the mechanisms underlying HPV-induced cervical cancer (CC) pathogenesis and the molecular signatures of drug resistance remain to be fully understood. Accumulating evidence has shown the involvement of kinase targets in the induction of drug resistance in high-risk (HR) HPV-CC. Molecularly, the genome of high-risk HPV is reported to control the expression of host kinases. In particular, Aurora kinases A, B, and C (ARKA, ARKB, and ARKC), phosphotidylinositol–trisphosphate kinase (PI3K)-Akt, and Glycogen synthase kinase3-α/β (GSK3 α/β) promote the transformation of infected cells, and also enhance the resistance of cells to various chemotherapeutic agents such as nelfinavir and cisplatin. However, the precise mechanisms through which HPV activates these kinases are yet to be fully elucidated. Furthermore, there is still ambiguity surrounding whether targeting HPV-induced kinases along with HPV-targeted therapies (such as phytopharmaceuticals and PROTAC/CRISPR-CAS-based systems) synergistically inhibit cervical tumor growth. Given the critical role of kinases in the pathogenesis and treatment of CC, a comprehensive review of current evidence is warranted. This review aims to provide key insights into the mechanisms of HPV-induced CC development, the involvement of kinases in drug resistance induction, and the rationale for combination therapies to improve clinical outcomes."
