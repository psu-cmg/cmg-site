abstract = "Background: Nirsevimab, a monoclonal antibody for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), reduces medically attended RSV infections. It was introduced in the 2023–24 RSV season. This study examined the association between caregiver vaccination (seasonal influenza vaccine (SIV), COVID-19, and boosters) and intent to immunize infants against RSV. Methods: Data from 118 caregivers with infants ≤ 8 months were analyzed. Chi-squared tests and logistic regression assessed the relationship between caregiver vaccination and intent to immunize against RSV. Results: In total, 74.6% of caregivers intended to immunize their infants against RSV. Intent was positively associated with caregiver receipt of a seasonal influenza vaccine (p < 0.001), COVID-19 vaccine (p < 0.001), and COVID-19 booster (p < 0.001). Intent was also associated with older child seasonal vaccination. Caregiver receipt of both COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters had a strong relationship with RSV immunization intent (OR 7.91 (1.90–33.0, p = 0.004)). Conclusions: Caregiver vaccination behaviors are linked to RSV immunization intent, helping physicians identify hesitant families and prepare for immunization conversations."
