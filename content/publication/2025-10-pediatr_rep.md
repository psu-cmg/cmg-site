abstract = "Background/Objectives: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and infant hospitalization in the US. RSV prevention evolved in 2023 as nirsevimab and maternal RSV pre-fusion vaccine became available for healthy newborns and infants. This study investigates sociodemographic characteristics associated with RSV immunoprophylaxis. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted from November 2023 through March 2024 among a convenience sample of parents of infants aged <8 months who received newborn care or pediatric ambulatory care at a single academic institution in Central Pennsylvania, USA. Logistic regression examined sociodemographic factors associated with RSV immunoprophylaxis uptake. Given the nirsevimab shortage during the 2023–2024 RSV season, a sensitivity analysis was completed for intended immunoprophylaxis. Results: Among 118 participants, 66.9% received RSV immunoprophylaxis while 74.5% intended to receive nirsevimab. Higher income, private insurance, out-of-home childcare, and an adult/partner working in healthcare were associated with intended nirsevimab receipt. Participation in the Women, Infants and Children program was associated with lower rates of intended nirsevimab receipt. Out-of-home childcare was associated with both RSV immunoprophylaxis uptake and intended nirsevimab receipt. Conclusions: Sociodemographic factors significantly influence the intent to receive nirsevimab and RSV immunoprophylaxis uptake. Having an adult/partner in healthcare was the most significant predictor for intent, suggesting that greater health literacy drives immunization intention. Enrollment in out-of-home childcare was the sole predictor of RSV immunoprophylaxis uptake. These findings highlight the importance of policy initiatives that promote equitable access to RSV immunoprophylaxis, including strategies to address socioeconomic barriers, improve health literacy, and ensure consistent availability of preventive agents for all infants."
