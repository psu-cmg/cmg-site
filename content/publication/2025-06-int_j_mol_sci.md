abstract = "Tumor development is mainly marked by the gradual transformation of cells that acquire capacities such as sustained growth signaling, evasion of growth suppression, resistance to cell death, and induction of angiogenesis, achieving replicative immortality and activating invasion and metastasis. How different epigenetic alterations like m1A, m5C, and m6A contribute to tumor development is a field that still needs to be investigated. The immune modulators, CD70, CD80, and TIGIT, mainly regulate T-cell activation and consequently the immune evasion of tumors. Here, we explored the presence and the potential consequences of RNA modifications in these regulators in pan-cancer. Our findings highlight the critical role of the m6A, m5C, and m1A in regulating CD70, CD80, and TIGIT across multiple solid tumors. By combining epitranscriptomics data with functional enrichment and survival modeling, we show that RNA modification enzymes not only modulate immune-related gene expression but also serve as potential biomarkers for patient prognosis. By constructing a robust four-gene prognostic signature involving YTHDF3, RBM15B, IGF2BP2, and TRMT61A, we demonstrate that RNA modification profiles can accurately stratify patients into risk groups with distinct overall survival outcomes. The performance of this model across eight cancer types underscores the translational promise of epitranscriptomic markers in both mechanistic understanding and personalized oncology. Altogether, our study bridges the gap between the mechanistic regulation of immune checkpoints and their clinical utility, offering novel insights into how the epitranscriptome can be leveraged to improve cancer prognosis and potentially enhance immunotherapeutic strategies."
